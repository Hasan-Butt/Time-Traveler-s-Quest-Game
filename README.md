# 🕹️ Time Traveler's Quest

**Time Traveler's Quest** is a C++ and SFML-based 2D adventure game which I have build in my first semester as my project, where the player travels between past and present to solve puzzles and open paths.
 Your objective is to find the keys some are in the past to unlock the door — all while navigating environmental challenges and solving riddles.

## 🎮 Features

- 🌌 Time travel mechanic (press `T` to switch between past & present)
- 🔑 Key-door logic across eras
- 🧱 Environmental interactions (e.g., water blocks, doors, bridges and riddles)
- 🔊 Sound effects and background music

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Build** the game using a C++ compiler with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) installed.
2. Place the required **SFML DLL files** in the same folder as the executable.
3. Run the game executable.

> ⚠️ Note: All images, sounds, and assets are in the **root folder**. Do not move them to subfolders unless you update paths in `TimeTravelerQuest Game.cpp`.
